# Problem 1 – Build a Table

Write a JavaScript function that takes as input an array of two numbers (**start** and **end**) and prints at the console a HTML table of 3 columns. The first column should hold a number **num**, changing from **start** to **end**. The second column should hold **num*num**. The third column should hold "**yes**" if **num** is Fibonacci number or "**no**" otherwise. The table should have header cells titled "**Num**", "**Square**" and "**Fib**". See the below examples.

## Input

The input data comes as **array of two numbers**: **start** and **end**.  The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

## Output

Print at the console the above described **table** in the same format like the examples below. Don't add additional spaces. **Whitespace** and character **casing** are important, so please use the same as in the below examples.

## Constraints
-	The input is passed to the first JavaScript function found in your code as array of 2 elements.
-	The numbers **start** and **end** are positive integers in the range \[1…1 000 000\] and **start** ≤ **end**.
-	Allowed working time for your program: 0.2 seconds.
-	Allowed memory: 16 MB.

## Examples

### Input #1
```
2
6
```
### Output #1
```
<table>
<tr><th>Num</th><th>Square</th><th>Fib</th></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>16</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>25</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>36</td><td>no</td></tr>
</table>
```

### Input #2
```
55
56
```

### Output #2
```
<table>
<tr><th>Num</th><th>Square</th><th>Fib</th></tr>
<tr><td>55</td><td>3025</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>56</td><td>3136</td><td>no</td></tr>
</table>
```
