# Problem 2 – Parachute

You find yourself in a training for being the **best parachute jumper** in the world. At the beginning of the training you need to understand how **gravity** and **wind** work. You are given all the data from previous jumps of your colleagues. Your task is to determine how the **jumper** will **finish** his jump and **where** he will **land** exactly, based on the gravity and wind parameters.

You are given an **array of strings**. The **jumper** can be **anywhere** in the array and is denoted by the **"o" symbol**. You need to determine the **movement** of the jumper in **iterations**. On each iteration the jumper moves **one line down**, pulled by **gravity**. Additionally, the jumper moves **sideways** by the **wind** on the **current** line.

<![if !supportLists]>· <![endif]>The **">" symbol** means the wind is moving the jumper **one position** to the **right**.

<![if !supportLists]>· <![endif]>The **"<" symbol** means the wind is moving the jumper **one position** to the **left**.

The **total direction** of the wind on a single line may **stack** (e.g. "**>>>**" moves the jumper 3 positions to the right; "**><<**" moves the jumper 1 position to the left).

See examples to better understand the motion of the jumper.

The jumper can move only through **air** (the **"-" symbol**). When the jumper hits the **ground**, **water** or a **cliff**, the jump is **finished** and you need to **print the outcome** of the jump.

### Input

The input will be passed to the first JavaScript function found in your code as **array of strings**, each containing a **symbol**. The **symbols** are **not separated** by anything. The input data will always be valid and in the format described.

### Output

The output consists of two lines. The first line holds a string: **"[landing place] ". There are 3 possible outcome messages:**

<![if !supportLists]>· <![endif]>If you have landed on the **ground** ("_" symbol), you are well and alive: **"Landed on the ground like a boss!"**

<![if !supportLists]>· <![endif]>If you have landed in the **water** ("~" symbol), you have drowned: "**Drowned in the water like a cat!"**

<![if !supportLists]>· <![endif]>If you have landed on **a cliff** ("/", "\" or "|" symbol), you have died: "**Got smacked on the rock like a dog!**

The second line holds the **position** (the **row** and **col**)  of your landing.

## Constraints

- The **row** and **col** of the matrix will be in the range **[0…10]**.
- The jumper will never fly off the map.
- Time limit: 0.3 sec. Memory limit: 16 MB.
