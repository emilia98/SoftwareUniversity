# Problem 3 – Use Your Chains, Buddy

You are in Cherny Vit now and there are 12km to Anchova Bichkiya Hut. You need to get there by car. But there is so much snow that you need to use car chains. In order to put them on the wheels correctly, you need to read the manual. But it is encrypted…

As input you will receive **an HTML document** as a **single string**. You need to get the text from **all the <p> tags** and replace all characters which are **not small letters and numbers** with a space **" "**. After that you must decrypt the text – all letters **from a to m** are **converted** to letters **from n to z** accordingly (a à n; b à o; … m à z). The letters **from n to z** are **converted** to letters **from a to m** accordingly (n à a; o à b; … z à m). All **multiple** spaces should then be replaced by only **one space**.

For example, if we have **"```<div>Santa</div><p>znahny # grkg ()&^^^&12</p>```"** we extract **"znahny # grkg ()&^^^&12"**. Every **character** that is **not a small letter or a number**  is replaced with a  space (**"znahny grkg  12"**). We convert each small letter as described above (**"znahny grkg  12"** **à** **"manual text  12"**) and replace all multiple spaces with only **one space** (**"manual text 12"**). Finally, we concatenate the decrypted text from all **```<p></p>```** tags (in this case, it's only one). And there you go – you have the manual ready to read!

## Input  
The input is passed to the first JavaScript function found in your code as array that has one element  – the string with the HTML document.

 The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

## Output  
Print at a single line the decrypted text of the manual. See the given examples below.

### Output #2
```
when driving in wet slippery snowy conditions snow dchains are absolutely 
essential for safe handling although snow chains may look intimidating the 
basic idea is really simple fit them over your tires drive forward slowly 
and tighten them up in cold wet conditions this is easier said than done 
but if you put on your tires
